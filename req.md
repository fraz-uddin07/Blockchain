Yes, you absolutely need to update that address manually. It's a critical step.

The placeholder `YOUR_DEPLOYED_TICKETNFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is a reminder that the address doesn't exist until you actually deploy your smart contract to a blockchain network (like a local testnet, the Sepolia testnet, or Ethereum mainnet). The deployment process is what generates the unique address for your contract.

Here is the step-by-step process to get the address and update your application.

### Step 1: Review Your Deployment Script

Your project contains a deployment script at `scripts/deploy.js`. This script is responsible for deploying your `TicketNFT` and `Marketplace` contracts and printing their new addresses to the console.

### Step 2: Run the Deployment Script

To deploy your contracts, you need to run the script using Hardhat. Open your terminal in the root of the `show-booking-app` directory and run the following command. For local testing, using the `localhost` network is recommended.

```bash
# This command will deploy to the Hardhat local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Step 3: Copy the Deployed Addresses

After the script finishes, your terminal will display the addresses of the newly deployed contracts. It will look something like this:

```
Deploying contracts with the account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
TicketNFT deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Marketplace deployed to: 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512
```

You will need both of these addresses.

### Step 4: Update Your Frontend Code (The Better Way)

Instead of manually pasting the addresses into every single page, the best practice is to create a central configuration file.

#### A. Create a `config.js` file:

**File: `show-booking-app/src/config.js` (New)**

```javascript
// This file holds the addresses of your deployed contracts.
// UPDATE THESE VALUES AFTER EACH DEPLOYMENT!

export const TICKET_NFT_ADDRESS = "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"; // Paste your TicketNFT address here
export const MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS = "0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512"; // Paste your Marketplace address here
```

#### B. Update the `MarketplacePage.jsx` to use the config file:

**File: `show-booking-app/src/pages/MarketplacePage.jsx` (Updated)**

```javascript
// ... other imports
import marketplaceAbi from '../artifacts/contracts/Marketplace.sol/Marketplace.json';
import { MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS } from '../config'; // Import from your new config file

const MarketplacePage = () => {
    // ... rest of the component is unchanged
    // The line defining MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS is now removed from here.
}
```

#### C. Update the `ScannerPage.jsx` to use the config file:

**File: `show-booking-app/src/pages/ScannerPage.jsx` (Updated)**

```javascript
// ... other imports
import ticketNftAbi from '../artifacts/contracts/TicketNFT.sol/TicketNFT.json';
import { TICKET_NFT_ADDRESS } from '../config'; // Import from your new config file

const ScannerPage = () => {
    // ... rest of the component is unchanged
    // The line defining TICKET_NFT_ADDRESS is now removed from here.
}
```

By using a central `config.js` file, you only have to update the addresses in one place whenever you redeploy your contracts, which is much cleaner and less error-prone.
